# My Blog learning F#

The purpose of this blog is to document my learning of F#. 
And this means I write to read it myself again.
If you are interested in learning F# this blog might help you, but the intention is just to help me.

I use github.io for the blog because I saw [this article of Colin Bull](http://www.colinbull.net/2014/11/04/Blogging-with-FSharp/).
